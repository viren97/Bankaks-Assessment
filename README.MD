Client folder contains React.js SPA, and the Server folder contains code for Express.js backend. 


### Client 

I have already placed all the required file to render client application in static {public} folder of the server. and serving 
it directly from the server. so no need to download, the dependencies, however one can proceed with client applicaiton by installing 
all the dependencies and running it locally by following below command 

### `cd Client/music-app`
### `npm i`
### `npm run start`


### Server 

Install all the dependecies, and run it locally by following below command
